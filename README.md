# Employee Task Management System

# About My Project
Developed a ReactJS-based Employee Task Management System to streamline task assignment and
tracking within an organization. Key features include:
- Role-based dashboard: Separate interfaces for admin and employees to manage tasks efficiently.
- Task tracking: Features to create, update, and categorize tasks by status (New, Active, Completed,
Failed).
- Local Storage Integration: Utilized browser local storage to persist user data and task statuses
